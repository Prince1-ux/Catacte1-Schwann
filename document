1. Project Title
  Colorful Circle Patterns Using Python Turtle
2. Purpose of the Project
  This project creates colorful circular patterns using Pythonâ€™s Turtle graphics.
3. How the Program Works and How to Run It
  The program sets up a black background and uses a loop to draw overlapping circles in multiple colors. 
  The turtle iterates through different colors while drawing circles and rotating slightly, creating a mesmerizing spiral effect.
To run the program, install Python and the turtle module if needed. Save the script and run it using python script_name.py.
  A Turtle window will display the colorful circular pattern, which can be customized by modifying angles, colors, or rotation steps.
